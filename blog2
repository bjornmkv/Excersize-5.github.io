        <h2>My experience with cheese:</h2>

        <h6>2/20/1988</h6>

        

        <p>I went to the store this year, and got cheese. I kept it all this time in a sock. I feel like it probably has gone up in value, but maybe not. </p>

        

        <h6>2/20/2020</h6>

        

        I checked up on my cheese. It has <strong>NOT</strong> appreciated in value. I feel like it has turned into something entirely else. I am dissapointed.

        I tried eating the cheese today, followed by a trip to the ER for food poisoning. I still think it might be better now that it has aged, but the doctor disagreed.

        I think i dont like cheese anymore.

    <ol>

        <li>Never buy too much cheese.</li>

        <li>The best cheese is fried cheese at a fair, <br>served by a <strong>professional</strong> Carny. </li>

        <li>never listen to doctors.</li>

    </ol>
